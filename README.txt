To build you will need to do this:
1. install NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)
2. download a binary distribution of Ant 1.7.0 from here: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
and extract it so that the folder named "apache-ant-1.7.0" is in the same directory as winant.nsi and info.txt

Then you just have to use the NSIS compiler on winant.nsi and that should build the installer for you.


May the force be with you...
